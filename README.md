## <a name="get-started"></a>Get started
  * Get a SignNow account [here](https://www.signnow.com/developers) 
  * SignNow uses Authorization: Basic `<credentials>`. To get your access token, have your client ID and secret base-64 encoded first


## <a name="platform-dependencies"></a>Platform Dependencies

## <a name="documentation"></a>Documentation

Read about the available SignNow features in [SignNow API Docs](https://help.signnow.com/).


## <a name="features"></a>Features

### <a name="authorization"></a> Authorization

Get your access token via OAuth 2.0 service.

```csharp
string clientId = "0fa****-EXAMPLE_CLIENT_ID-****13";
string clientSecret = "0fb**-EXAMPLE_CLIENT_SECRET-**13";

string userLogin = "signnow_dotnet_sdk@example.com";
string userPassword = "example-user-password";

var oauth = new OAuth2Service(clientId, clientSecret);

var token = oauth.GetTokenAsync(userLogin, userPassword, Scope.All).Result;
}
```

### <a name="upload-document"></a> Upload a document to SignNow

All the features in SignNow require a `document_id`. Once you upload a document to SignNow, you get the `document_id` from a successful response.
```csharp
string documentId = default;

var pdfFilePath = "./file-path/document-example.pdf";
var pdfFileName = "document-example.pdf";

/// using token from the Authorization step
var documentService = new DocumentService(token);

using (var fileStream = File.OpenRead(pdfFilePath))
{
    var uploadResponse = documentService.UploadDocumentAsync(fileStream, pdfFileName, default).Result;

    documentId = uploadResponse.Id;
}
```

### <a name="download-document"></a> Download a document from SignNow

Choose the type of download for your document:
* `PdfOriginal` - download a document in a state it's been when uploaded to SignNow, before any changes
* `PdfCollapsed` - download a document in PDF file format
* `ZipCollapsed` - download a document in ZIP archive
* `PdfWithHistory` - download a document with its history, a full log of changes on a separate page.

```csharp
/// using `documentId` from the Upload document step

var downloadPdf = documentService.DownloadDocumentAsync(documentId, downloadType.PdfCollapsed).Result;

Console.WriteLine("Downloaded successful: " + downloadPdf.Filename);
```

### <a name="create-signing-link"></a> Create a single-use link to the document for signature 

You generate a link for sharing the document to be signed. It's called signing link in SignNow. Having followed the link, signers can click anywhere on the document to sign it.

Steps:

▶ Upload a document or Get the ID of the document you’d like to have signed

▶ Send a signing link


```csharp
/// using `documentId` from the Upload document step

var signingLinks = documentService.CreateSigningLinkAsync(documentId).Result;

Console.WriteLine("Authorize and Sign the Document" + signingLinks.Url);
Console.WriteLine("Sign the Document" + signingLinks.AnonymousUrl);
```
